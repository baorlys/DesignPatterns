# Decorator 
**Also known as:** Wrapper.

The Decorator design pattern is a structural pattern used to dynamically add behavior to objects without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. Itâ€™s particularly useful when you need to add responsibilities to objects in a flexible and reusable manner.

## Key Components

- Component: Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.
- ConcreteComponent: The base object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.
- Decorator: Maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to the Component's interface.
- ConcreteDecorator: Adds responsibilities to the component by extending the Decorator class.

## Benefits

- Flexibility: You can add responsibilities to objects at runtime.
- Single Responsibility Principle: You can extend functionality by adding new decorators without changing existing code.
- Open/Closed Principle: Systems are open for extension but closed for modification.

## Drawbacks

- Complexity: The pattern can be complex, especially when you have multiple decorators.
- Order of decorators: The order in which decorators are applied can affect the behavior of the system.

## Use cases

- Extending functionality of classes without modifying existing code.
- Adding responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- Implementing multiple optional behaviors.
