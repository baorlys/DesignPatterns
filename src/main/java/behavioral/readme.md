# Behavioral Design Patterns

**Behavioral Design Patterns** focus on communication between objects, how they interact, and how responsibilities are distributed among them. They help manage algorithms, responsibilities, and the flow of control between objects, ensuring that the system is flexible and easy to extend.

Here are some common behavioral design patterns:

1. [**Chain of Responsibility**](chain_of_responsibility): Passes a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler can process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers.

2. [**Command**](command): Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides support for undoable operations.

3. **Interpreter**: Defines a grammar for interpreting sentences in a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences according to the grammar. It is often used in designing compilers or interpreters.

4. **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. This pattern is used to traverse collections of objects.

5. **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly and allows their interaction to be mediated by a central object.

6. **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to that state later. It is used to implement undo mechanisms.

7. [**Observer**](observer): Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is often used in event handling systems.

8. **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. This pattern is used to implement state machines.

9. [**Strategy**](strategy): Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.

10. [**Template Method**](template_method): Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but lets subclasses redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern is useful for implementing invariant parts of an algorithm while allowing customization.

11. **Visitor**: Defines a new operation to a class of objects without changing the classes themselves. It allows operations to be performed on elements of an object structure, adding new functionality without modifying the elements.

Behavioral patterns are about how objects interact and cooperate, and they help in designing systems that are easy to maintain and extend.
