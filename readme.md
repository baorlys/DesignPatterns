## [1. Creational Patterns](src/main/java/creational)
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

## [2. Structural Patterns](src/main/java/structural)
Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.


## [3. Behavioral Patterns](src/main/java/behavioral)
Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
